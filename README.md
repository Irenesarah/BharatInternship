As Part of my internship at Bharat Intern, I am hereby sharing al the tasks that has been allocated to me

Task 1
STOCK PREDICTION USING LSTM
Stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a common application of deep learning in finance.LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture and learn complex patterns in sequential data, making them suitable for time series forecasting.Using LSTM in stock prediction, historical price and volume data are processed to capture temporal patterns. LSTM learns to make future stock price forecasts by analyzing sequential data.

Task 2
TITANIC CLASSIFICATION
Titanic classification using a Random Forest is a machine learning approach to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions based on features like age, gender, and ticket class, making it a robust model for this task.

Task 3
NUMBER RECOGNITION USING MNIST DATASET
Number recognition with the MNIST dataset involves training a machine learning model, typically a neural network, on a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The model learns to classify these digits accurately, making it a fundamental task in computer vision and pattern recognition applications.
